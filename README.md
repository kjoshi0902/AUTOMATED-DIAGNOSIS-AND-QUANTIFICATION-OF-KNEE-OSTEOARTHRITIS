# 🩺 Automated Diagnosis and Quantification of Knee Osteoarthritis

An **end-to-end deep learning system** for automated **Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis** from X-ray images, integrating **ensemble classification, anatomical segmentation, and quantitative Joint Space Width (JSW) measurement**.

This project provides a **clinically reliable and explainable AI-based diagnostic pipeline** aimed at reducing subjectivity in manual radiographic assessment.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Manual grading of Knee Osteoarthritis using X-ray images is **subjective**, time-consuming, and prone to **inter-observer variability**, especially in early and borderline cases.

This project addresses these challenges by:
- Automating KOA severity classification  
- Precisely segmenting the knee joint region  
- Quantifying disease progression using **Joint Space Width (JSW) in millimeters**

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Ensemble CNN-based classification** for robust KOA severity prediction  
- **Mask R-CNN segmentation** for accurate knee joint localization  
- **Automated JSW measurement** for objective disease quantification  
- **Clinically aligned severity mapping** (Healthy / Moderate / Severe)  
- High performance with **~99% classification accuracy**

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Median Filtering for noise reduction  
- CLAHE for contrast enhancement  
- Data Augmentation to balance class distribution  

### 2️⃣ KOA Severity Classification
- Transfer Learning using:
  - DenseNet121
